# scala-cli-sbt-crypto-aes-password-salt

## Description
A demo for AES encryption of a password.
AES is a 256 byte encryption. SALT is the
mixing of the original text with a secret key.
It is considered more secure to store the
SALT then the encrypted original text, however
this can still be cracked with rainbow tables.
